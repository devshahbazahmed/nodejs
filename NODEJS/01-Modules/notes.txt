Modules

1. Built in modules - NodeJS gives you out of the box
2. Third party (External Modules) - Can download from the internet - npm isntall
3. Custom Modules (My own) modules - We can create - Custom directory - ./ , ../ , ../../

File System (fs - module)

require function first searches for third party modules then for the built in modules then for the custom modules and if not found in any it throws an error.

package.json -> Config file for your project

npm install package_name command gets the package from the internet and stores it in the node_modules folder

package-lock.json maintains dependencies of dependencies

sync version in fs means this is going to be a blocking version
